 * Coder 2 parity (#160 / epic #58).
 *
 * The claim being tested is "a declared Coder is as capable as the hardcoded one". That is a
 * claim about DATA — the capabilities the templates declare — so it is checkable, and left
 * unchecked it is the kind of thing that quietly stops being true the next time someone edits
 * either side.
 *
 * Migration 0054 is the reference: it is what the hardcoded `coder` actually has today.
